# Summary

- To demonstrate and compare the use of design patterns and lambda functions, I have implemented program which will generate Hash Sum 
  for the given input using MD5 and SHA256 Message Digest Algorithms.
- The design pattern used is Strategy - with two Strategies for each Algorithm.
- Design pattern provide loose coupling between the objects , however it involves creation of more number of participants/classes/files.
- The Lambda function  on the other side help to implement the same logic very precisely in single file. 
- And also add much readbility to the code.
