part 1 - UML Class Diagram

All Classes and Interfaces in the program are included as Classifiers.

Emptied the Attributes Compartment by unclicking Attribute Compartment under Initial Visibility.

Only Public Methods (including Constructors) have been shown for all the classes.

I chose NOT to show Methods Implemented from Interfaces to avoid noise, so removed  those inherited methods from the Class classifiers.

I changed Abstract classes methods from "italics".

Method Signatures are shown on Interfaces.

Dependency relationships with the Interfaces have been shown.

Multiplicities are shown among classes and Interfaces.

part 2 - UML Sequence Diagram

Drew all Participants (Objects) with their actual Class Types.

Drew Activation Bars and proper Stack period for every method invocation.

Arguments have been mentioned for all method invocations.

Did not show return message lines , instead printed output to console from Diagram.
