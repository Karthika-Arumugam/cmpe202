##############lab3 OBSERVER SEQUENCE PATTERN DIAGRAM##########################


Debugged the Observer Pattern code in BlueJ using Single-Steps and took Screenshots of the code in the debugger for each method call in the Sequence Diagram.
 Provided a short "one line" caption referencing the UML Sequence Message Index Number.
Participants are only Objects (i.e. not Interfaces).  
Objects have been  represented by their runtime type (i.e. obj.getClass().getName())
I did not show constructor calls, only message calls have been illustrated.
