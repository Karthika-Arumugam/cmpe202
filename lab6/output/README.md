Patterns used in LAB6 for Five Guys reciept and package Slip 

1. Composite pattern 

I used composite pattern to form a order from different items together like Burger,Toppings and Fries(if any).

Interface - Component
Classes - Composite and its child classes are Burger are differnt items that all to be grouped together under composit object to print the reciept and package slip .

2.Strategy patterns
I used the strategy pattern to have different sorting algorithms in building the reciept for order and its corresponding package slip.

The classes I created for strategy are:

Interface -PrintStrategy
Class-PrintReceipt 
Class - PrintPackageSlip 


Please find the two images in the output folder one for package slip and other for reciept .
